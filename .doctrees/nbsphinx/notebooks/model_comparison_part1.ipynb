    "So far we have focussed on using a Bayesian workflow to design and develop a single model to describe our data. Much of the time, this will be enough to answer the scientific questions that we come across in our research. By using [model checking](model_checking.ipynb) to develop a model and verify that it is capable of representing the data, we are implicity using *predictive performance* to compare models, in a process of continuous model expansion.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there may be cases where it makes sense to compare two or more distinct models in a more discrete way. E.g. Models for the **presence or absence** of an effect, or **signal over background** models. Consider the following questions:\n",

    "\n",
    "**$\\mathcal{M}$-closed:** It is reasonable to assume that the true model is part of the set of models under consideration. You can assign prior probabilities to each model in the set.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* This is the worst-case scenario! Imagine trying to design a model to predict human behaviour, or one that is capable of generating the work of a famous author. One can look for patterns, but it doesn't make sense to try and write down the mind of a person as a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**$\\mathcal{M}$-complete:** It is reasonable to assume that a true model exists, but it is impossible to come up with a complete list of possible candidate models. \n",
    "\n",
    "* In practice, this is the case in which we find ourselves most of the time. M-closed problems tend to be too simple to be really interesting, whereas M-open ones are too complex to even attempt with these kind of methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the M-complete view, it makes sense to work towards a *good enough* model that can represent our observations and anser our questions, as we have been doing so far in this workflow. However, one could also think about selecting between a finite set of models, that act as a proxy for a complete list of possible models.\n",

    "It is important to note that many of the more standard and widely used methods for Bayesian model comparison that rely on the **model marginal likelihood**, $p(\\mathrm{data}|\\mathrm{model})$, and/or **model priors**, $p(\\mathrm{model})$, assume that we are in the M-closed regime. As soon as we are not sure that we are in this regime, we should be very careful about interpreting the results of such approaches, and the further away we go, the worse it gets..."
